### Overview of the Project
The To-Do List Application with Local Storage is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, with all data being stored locally in the browser. This ensures that tasks persist even when the user closes the browser or reloads the page.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a functional to-do list application that allows users to:

Add new tasks to their to-do list.
View existing tasks in a clear and organized manner.
Edit tasks to update or modify their content.
Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
Persist tasks across browser sessions using local storage.
This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient tool for task management, leveraging local storage to ensure that user data remains intact between sessions.


### Key Activities
Task Creation:
Users can input new tasks using a text field.
A "Add Task" button allows users to add the task to their list.

**Task Viewing:**
All tasks are displayed in a list format.
Each task appears with options to edit or delete.

**Task Editing:**
Users can update the text of any task by clicking the "Edit" button.
A prompt allows users to enter the new task description.
Changes are automatically saved in local storage.

**Task Deletion:**
Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
The task is removed both from the list and local storage.

**Data Persistence:**
All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage.
Tasks persist even after the browser is closed or the page is reloaded.

### Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the application.
CSS: Used for styling the interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Handles the functionality of the application, including adding, editing, deleting tasks, and managing local storage.
Local Storage: A web storage API used to store task data within the user's browser, ensuring persistence across sessions.
